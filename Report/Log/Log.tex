\section{Week 1}
\subsection{Introduction}
This week we were introduced to the course and the upcoming project we would be assigned to do.

\subsection{Groups}
We were told to make groups of three for next week. Since the other class was not here, we could not continue any further and class was dismissed...
 
\section{Week 2}
\subsection{Introduction to Arduino}
This week we were introduced to programming on an Arduino. We used the Arduino IDE to write the code which would be deployed on an Arduino which was fixed to circuits system on a Breadboard.

\subsection{Sensors}
Today we added an ultra-sonic sensor to the circuits system to measure distance to an obstacle. The goal was to make the built-in LED blink for 1/10 of a second when an obstacle was less than 30 cm away but more than 25 cm away, 3/10 of a second when an obstacle was less then 25 cm away and more than 20 cm away and if the distance between the obstacle and the sensor was less than 20 cm away the LED should turn on constantly.

\subsection{Errors}
According to the datasheet\footnote{https://www.maxbotix.com/documents/LV-MaxSonar-EZ_Datasheet.pdf }  the sensor outputs an analog voltage of 9.8 mV/in from a 5V voltage supply.
